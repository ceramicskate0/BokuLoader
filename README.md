# BokuLoader - Cobalt Strike Reflective Loader
Cobalt Strike User-Defined Reflective Loader written in Assembly & C for advanced evasion capabilities.

### Contributors: [Bobby Cooke @0xBoku](https://twitter.com/0xBoku) & [Santiago Pecin @s4ntiago_p](https://twitter.com/s4ntiago_p) 

## Features
+ Supports `obfuscate "true"`
+ Supports `sleepmask "true"` & all sleepmask kit options 
  + default sleepmask, sleepmask kit 47, sleepmask `MASK_TEXT_SECTION 1`, and Ekko implementation all tested & work
+ Stomp MZ Magic Bytes
+ Find-Self EggHunter
+ Direct NT Syscalls via HellsGate & HalosGate
+ PE Header Obfuscation
+ PE String Replacement
+ NOHEADERCOPY - Loader will not copy headers over to beacon. Decommits the first memory page which would normally hold the headers
+ NoRWX -  The Reflective loader writes beacon with Read & Write permissions and after resolving Beacons Import Table & Relocations, changes the .TEXT code section of Beacon to Read & Execute permissions 
+ XGetProcAddress for resolving symbols
+ 100k UDRL Size
+ Caesar Cipher for string obfuscation
+ Prepend ASM Instructions
+ Supports Malleable C2 profile option `cleanup "true"`

## Project Origins
+ Based on Stephen Fewer's incredible Reflective Loader project: 
  + https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection
+ Initially created while working through Renz0h's Reflective DLL videos from the [Sektor7 Malware Developer Intermediate (MDI) Course](https://institute.sektor7.net/courses/rto-maldev-intermediate/) 

## Usage
1. Compile the BokuLoader Object file with `make`
2. Start your Cobalt Strike Team Server
3. Within Cobalt Strike, import the `BokuLoader.cna` Aggressor script
4. Generate the x64 beacon (Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S))
5. Use the `Script Console` to ensure BokuLoader was implemented in the beacon build

+ Does not support x86 option. The x86 bin is the original Reflective Loader object file.  
+ Generating `RAW` beacons works out of the box. When using the Artifact Kit for the beacon loader, the `stagesize` variable must be larger than the default.
  + See the [Cobalt Strike User-Defined Reflective Loader documenation](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/malleable-c2-extend_user-defined-rdll.htm) for additional information

## Detection Guidance
+ BokuLoader changes some commonly detected strings to new hardcoded values. These strings can be used to signature BokuLoader:

|Original Cobalt Strike String|BokuLoader Cobalt Strike String|
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|ReflectiveLoader|~~djoiqnfkjlnslfmn~~|
|Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0|~~12367321236742382543232341241261363163151d~~|
|(admin)|~~(tomin)~~|
|beacon|~~bacons~~|
+ BokuLoader calls the following NT systemcalls to setup the loaded executable beacon memory: `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtProtectVirtualMemory`, `NtFreeVirtualMemory`
  + These are called directly from the BokuLoader executable memory. These system calls are not backed by NTDLL memory.
  + Setting userland hooks in `ntdll.dll` will not detect these systemcalls.
  + It may be possible to register kernelcallbacks using a kernel driver to monitor for the above system calls and detect their usage when they are not called from `ntdll.dll`.
  + The BokuLoader itself will contain the `mov eax, r11d; syscall; ret` assembly instructions within its executable memory.
+ The loaded beacon memory is hardcoded as a `Private: Commit` memory region and is `292KB`.
  + The memory section will be loaded at a `+0x1000` offset. This is due to the first 0x1000 bytes of the memory being deallocated within BokuLoader.
+ The BokuLoader source code is provided within the repository and can be used to create memory signatures.
+ If you have additional detection guidance, please feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request.
